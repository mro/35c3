<h2>Lecture: Planes and Ships and Saving Lives</h2>
<h3 class="title">How soft and hardware can play a key role in saving lives at sea and why Frontex doesn´t like it</h3>

<p class="abstract">The death rate at Europes seaborder reached a historical record: One out of five trying for Europe drowned this September: Main reason is the crackdown on sea rescue by European authorithies who barely pass any information on distress cases to competent rescue workers. The hope of those trying to escape torture, slavery hunger and other forms of violence therefore soleyly lies on the efforts of the civil rescue fleet. 
<br>In the future, a civil society run maritime rescue coordination center could help to significantly reduce the death rate at sea. This talk will focus on the software and hardware components used on the aerial and nautical assets of the civil rescue fleet. 
<br>We´ll talk about the difficulties installing sat com on a moving ship or even an aircraft, how the camera system of the Sea-Watch 3 recorded the evidence that is now challenging the Italian state at the European Court of human rights, how important data is secured if the state challenges you as in the case of the LIFELINE and about a software that will help to join forces in the near future to coordinate rescues in an efficient way. Help is still needed to tear down Europes wall. </p>
<p class="description">The death rate at Europes seaborder reached a historical record this year: One out of five people, who left wartorn libya on flimsy boats, bound for Europe, drowned in September 2018. The main reason for the increasing death rate ist the crackdown on sea rescue by European authorithies. Back in 2015 and 2016, when rescue NGOs took up rescue efforts on the deadliest waters of the world, the Italian Coast Guard, the NGOS and even the European Navy worked hand in hand, to save as many lives as possible. Nowadays European authorithies are trying to turn the central med into a blackbox: As they rather want to watch people drown then to see them arrive at Europes shores, and barely any information on distress cases is passed to competent rescue workers, the hope of those trying to escape torture, slavery hunger and other forms of violence soleyly lies on the efforts of the civil rescue fleet. </p>

<p class="description">Since no rescue coordination center clearly takes responsibility in favor of those in distress, the technical means of communication and such to increase the search capacity or to document incidents at sea, used on the aerial and nautical assets of the civil rescue fleet, do play a key role in the efforts to coordinate rescues d.i.y. </p>

<p class="description">In the future, a civil society run maritime rescue coordination center could help to significantly reduce the death rate at sea. This talk focuses on the software and hardware components necessary to challenge Europes deadly border policy of letting people drown. 
<br>We´ll talk about the difficulties installing sat com on a moving ship or even an aircraft, how the camera system of the Sea-Watch 3 recorded the evidence that is now challenging the Italian state at the European Court of human rights, how important data is secured if the state fights back as in the case of the LIFELINE and about a software that will help to join forces in the near future to be even more efficient. </p>

<p class="description">We will talk about standards (NMEA0183, NMEA2000), Communication technologies (VSAT, IRIDIUM), Positioning and information/communication systems and anti collision systems (RADAR, GPS, AIS) Other interesting devices to be found aboard (Gyrocompass, etc.) and of course our setup (OpenWRT, OLSR, Ansible, Wireguard) and open source applications for nautic purpose (weather, navigation, etc: ZyGRIB, OpenCPN).</p>
