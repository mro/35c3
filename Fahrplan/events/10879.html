<h2>Lecture: HAL - The Open-Source Hardware Analyzer</h2>
<h3 class="title">A dive into the foundations of hardware reverse engineering and our netlist analysis framework HAL</h3>
<div class="column left" id="basic">

<p class="abstract">Since the Snowden revelations the fear of stealthy hardware manipulations is no longer regarded as far fetched.
<br>This fear is also reflected in the massive discussions sparked by last year's Bloomberg allegations on a supposed hardware spy implant on Supermicro serverboards or the recent USA ban on Huawei telecommunication equipment.</p>

<p class="abstract">Hardware reverse engineering (HRE) is a promising method to detect such manipulations or hidden backdoors.
<br>However, HRE is a highly complex and cumbersome task.
<br>It takes months of work as well as expensive equipment to even obtain the netlist of a chip, the equivalent to the binary in software reverse engineering (SRE).
<br>In contrast to SRE where various paid or open-source tools for binary analysis exist, e.g., IDA Pro or Ghidra, in HRE simply no tool for netlist analysis were available - neither commercial, nor free.
<br>To close this gap, researchers from the Ruhr University Bochum developed HAL, the first open-source netlist analysis framework.</p>

<p class="abstract">In this talk, we start with a basic introduction into the challenges of HRE.
<br>Then, we demonstrate the capabilities of HAL before giving a brief overview on our current research with HAL.</p>
<p class="description">Hardware reverse engineering (HRE) is an important technique for analysts to understand the internals of a physical system.
<br>Use cases range from recovering interface specifications of old chips, over detection of malicious manipulations or patent infringements, to straight up counterfeiting.
<br>However, HRE is a notably complex and cumbersome task which consists of two phases:
<br>In the first phase the netlist, i.e., circuit description of a chip, has to be extracted from the physical device.
<br>Such a netlist is equivalent to the binary in software reverse engineering (SRE).
<br>In the second phase, the analyst then processes the netlist in order to understand (parts of) its functionality.</p>

<p class="description">However, obtaining a netlist from a chip can take several months and requires professional and costly equipment as well as expertise.
<br>Even with a recovered netlist, understanding its functionality is an enormously challenging task.
<br>This is partly due to the lack of proper tools for netlist analysis:
<br>While in SRE various commercial or open-source tools for binary analysis exist, e.g., IDA Pro or Ghidra, in HRE simply no tool for netlist analysis was available, neither commercial, nor free.
<br>To close this gap, researchers from the Embedded Security group of the Horst-GÃ¶rtz Institute for IT-Security at the Ruhr University Bochum developed HAL, the first open-source netlist analysis framework.
<br>Inspired by the modularity of its SRE equivalents, HAL can be extended through optimized C++ plugins or directly used as a Python library, while at the same time offering a GUI for explorative and interactive analysis.
<br>The project is supposed to give hardware analysts a common platform for the development of new algorithms with a portable design, ultimately aiding both professionals in their daily work as well as researchers in their efforts to publish reproducible results.</p>

<p class="description">In this talk, we will first introduce the foundations and main challenges of HRE, before giving a live demonstration of HAL and some of its capabilities on selected case studies.
<br>We conclude the talk with a glimpse at our associated research at the university that spans both, technical research as well as cross-disciplinary work with psychologists.</p>

<p class="description">Our talk requires only minimum prior knowledge on digital hardware.</p>
